This is an exercise to practice using APIs

When ran, Reader.py will pull the first page of new posts from reddit.com/r/todayilearned and print them, formatted, to the command line.

FUTURE UPDATES:
1. Support for storing all new facts in a text file
2. Automation to find new facts as they get posts
3. Twitter integration, posting facts that are 140 characters or less to Twitter
