This is an exercise to practice using APIs

When ran, Reader.py will pull the first page of new posts from reddit.com/r/todayilearned and print them, formatted, into a text file.

FUTURE UPDATES:
1. Update functionality for Python 3
2. Automation to find new facts as they are posted
3. Twitter integration, posting facts that are 140 characters or less to Twitter
